# Magnolia Javascript Models - reCAPTCHA Version 3

A fork of BIT IT's reCAPTCHA v3 updated for 6.2. Google's reCAPTCHA v3 returns a score for each request without user friction. The score is based on interactions with your site and enables you to take an appropriate action for your site. The module includes decorations for the form module so no assembly required. Simply make the form components available on your site.
